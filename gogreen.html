Pull Printing is a printing feature where a user's print job is held on a server or on a user's workstation and released by the user at any printing device which supports this feature. To utilize pull printing, users must be authenticated at the printer using either embedded software or an external device based on the capabilities of your machine. Users then select from a list of print jobs upon arriving at a printer. The advantages are not only cost effective and environmentally friendly; it also creates flexibility, security and management of print jobs.</p>
